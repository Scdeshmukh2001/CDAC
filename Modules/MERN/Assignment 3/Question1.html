    <p id ="p1"> It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life. When a person leads a disciplined life, 
        they set an easy path to success. They will develop an approach to happiness and a beautiful future ahead.
         Being disciplined is the practice of having a scheduled daily routine which helps an individual to be punctual and hard-working. 
         An individual is taught what being disciplined means from the time they are young. 
         Even though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of a disciplined life make it a worthwhile endeavour.
